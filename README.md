A mini libraray understood and made by me with proper chaining and jQuery supported

I have made a new mini-library reusable, chained, and JQuery supported in JavaScript.

Itâ€™s used to welcome the user in different languages.

It uses prototypal inheritance, immediately invoked function expression and other advanced concepts of javascript.

Similar to Jquery's source code.
